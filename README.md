<h1>IDS/ZEEK Network Monitoring Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab we will be conducting IDS/ZEEK Network Monitoring. This project is great because it helps strengthen my understanding on how signatures are created and used to alert on suspecious network traffic. Utilizing an IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
such as Snort or Suracata can quickly help identify suspicious traffic, while ZEEK will help me break down the PCAP into easily digestable information and allow for correlation. Objectives are to Spin up SNORT+ZEEK and configure the tools to monitor my local network, read a malicious PCAP using an IDS, and use ZEEK to parse the malicious ASAP. I will also learn how to download PCAP from malware-traffic-analyisis and how to utilize zeek-cut & analyze the data
